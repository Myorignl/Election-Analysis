  * The destination folder was captalized, when creating a path the  names have to be exact or an error is generated.
  * Each new variable has to be declared or the code is unable to read.  A variable name should not be repeated as it will not run corrently
  
## Challenge Summary

Python made it possible to determin a winner by processing a very large number of votes in a matter of seconds. The alignment of each block of code has to be in the right place, to ensure this is done correctly I created my if statement and then tabed to the next line. The program has it's learning curve but will be extemly usefull in future projects.
