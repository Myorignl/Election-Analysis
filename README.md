# Election-Analysis
At this time the file is not loading, I have worked with the TA's to resolved and the TA could not figure out why is not working. I tried directly loading the excel but was advised against it as the assignment requires loading the file correctly. Folders are set as follows: Python folder> Assignment_03-Pypoll >challenge folder(contains pypoll) and Res folder(contains csv file). If I spend any more time in this assignment I will be severely behind in class. All sections  have been completed as instructed. Help troubleshooting what went wrong and feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
